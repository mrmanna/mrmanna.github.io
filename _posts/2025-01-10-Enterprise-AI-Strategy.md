### The Changing Tide: A Quick Anecdote

A few years back, I worked with a large global enterprise to streamline their _Order to Cash_ (O2C) process. We set up a robust Business Process Management (BPM) architecture, integrated it with middleware, and automated the usual suspects: invoicing, billing, and order tracking. It was a success — until the company realized their data was scattered across multiple silos. They wanted deeper insights and predictions, not just a slick workflow.

> “Can our process engine also forecast demand?” the CFO asked.

At the time, the answer was: _“Not really — unless we call in a separate AI solution.”_
Fast-forward to today, and we see new, more powerful _AI Agents_ that can orchestrate workflows **and** tap into _AI Models_ for decision-making. The gap between **automation** and **intelligence** is finally closing, bringing greater operational resilience and competitive advantage.

### Why My Book & Why Now?

Last year in my book, [_Enterprise AI: Strategic Blueprint for Purple People_](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0D5RKHXMY), I explore how large organizations can harness AI across sprawling units and geographies without losing focus or momentum. Early on, I emphasized a distinction between non-cognitive, rules-based tasks — **Automation** — and cognitive, judgment-oriented tasks — **Intelligence**.

### Why does this matter in 2025 and beyond?

Because businesses must handle both: the mundane grunt work (creating purchase orders, logging invoices, etc.) **and** the strategic insights (forecasting, risk modeling, personalized recommendations). If you only automate the drudgery without empowering strategic decisions with AI, you miss out on transformative innovation. Conversely, if you adopt fancy AI Models without a strong operational foundation, you’ll end up with brilliant ideas stuck in an unmanageable tangle of processes.

**And what about the “Purple People?”** They are the invaluable professionals who bridge the worlds of business and technology — equally comfortable with strategic objectives and technical realities. The frameworks laid out in my book are specifically designed to empower these individuals, showing them how to lead AI-driven initiatives that align with core enterprise goals.

### From BPM & Middleware to AI Agents

For decades, BPM and middleware solutions have been the unsung heroes in enterprise landscapes. Think of **BPM** as the “orchestra conductor,” telling various applications, people, and data sources when to play their part. **Middleware** is the “communications hub,” ensuring data moves seamlessly across systems.

But traditional BPM can only do so much. Rules-based flows handle straightforward conditions: “If invoice is overdue, send email.” That’s fine until the real world intrudes with uncertainty, exceptions, and the need for quick adaptation. When supply chains fluctuate or payment behaviors shift, static rules can’t keep pace.

**Enter AI Agents**: They build on that BPM foundation but add memory, chaining, and flexible decision-making. They can recall earlier steps in a process, dynamically shift based on new data, and coordinate multiple AI Models to handle changes in real time.

This evolution means BPM is no longer limited to “if-then” scripts — now, it can adjust and re-route based on predictive insights from your AI Models, reinforcing more resilient processes.

### Automation (AI Agents) vs. Intelligence (AI Models)

Here’s the big takeaway: **AI Agents** and **AI Models** are not the same thing, though they often work hand in hand.

#### **AI Agents (Automation)**

*   Best thought of as “digital workers” carrying out tasks.
*   Operate within or on top of BPM or workflow systems, orchestrating step-by-step operations.
*   Have “memory” and “chaining” capabilities — i.e., they can hold context about what happened in Step A as they move on to Step B.
*   **Example**: In a procurement process, an AI Agent checks stock levels, compares supplier bids, and fires off a purchase order with minimal human intervention.

#### **AI Models (Intelligence)**

*   Mathematical or statistical engines that produce insights, predictions, or recommendations.
*   Typically trained on large datasets — think machine learning, neural networks, or large language models (LLMs).
*   **Example**: A demand-forecasting model that predicts sales volumes or an LLM that analyzes customer feedback to recommend new product features.

**One “does” the work, the other “thinks.”**

By combining them, you get a closed loop: the AI Agent orchestrates tasks, calls an AI Model for analysis, and returns to the workflow armed with fresh intelligence. This synergy can significantly reduce errors, improve adaptation to market shifts, and free teams to focus on creative problem-solving.

### Real-World Snapshot: Upgrading O2C with AI

**Let’s revisit the O2C process:**

**Traditional BPM**

*   You’d have a workflow that triggers an invoice upon shipment, sets payment reminders, and updates inventory in the ERP.

**AI-Enhanced O2C**

*   An **AI Agent** continuously monitors orders.
*   If a high-value order goes unpaid beyond a certain point, the agent calls a **credit risk model** (an AI Model) trained on historical payment data.
*   Depending on the risk score, the agent either escalates to a credit control team or sends a personalized offer for partial settlement.

In this scenario, the synergy is clear. The agent is the actor performing tasks; the model provides predictive intelligence. Together, they can reduce revenue leakage and build better customer relationships, directly impacting both top-line growth and operational efficiency.

### Market Direction: Anthropic, Microsoft, OpenAI, & More

Anthropic’s research emphasizes building effective AI agents by combining large language models (LLMs) with tools and memory to create flexible, model-driven decision-making systems. Other players — Microsoft with Copilot, OpenAI with ChatGPT plugins — are also integrating “agent-like” orchestration layers that manage data retrieval, call external APIs, and adapt to user or system inputs in real time.

**The consistent theme is clear**: every major AI provider is racing to give businesses an **agent** that doesn’t just answer questions but takes action. This action-driven approach builds directly on BPM philosophies

> — “process orchestration meets AI”

— and highlights why now is the ideal time for enterprises to shape their AI roadmap.

### Action Steps & Conclusion

What does all this mean for business and technology leaders looking for tangible outcomes — like cost savings, revenue boosts, or risk mitigation?

#### **Leverage Familiar Frameworks**

*   Don’t abandon BPM or middleware. Instead, enrich them with AI Agents that bring flexibility and memory.
*   This strategy lowers the risk of **“rip-and-replace”** projects and helps you maintain compliance across established processes.

#### **Identify the Right Models**

*   Pinpoint critical decision points (e.g., supplier evaluation, forecasting, resource allocation) where AI Models can generate real ROI.
*   Ensure you integrate them in a way that addresses real business pains, **not just “tech for tech’s sake.”**

#### **Experiment with Pilot Projects**

*   **Start small** — maybe an AI Agent that integrates with a forecasting model on a single business process.
*   Demonstrate **quick wins** and validate alignment with regulatory or data-privacy requirements. Then scale.

#### **Anticipate Pitfalls and Set Guardrails**

*   AI-driven workflows can fail **without quality data** or proper oversight.
*   Make sure you have a monitoring plan for model drift, compliance checks, and human escalation paths for exceptions.

#### **Empower Your ‘Purple People’**

*   The enterprise “architects of change” often live at the intersection of business strategy and technology.
*   Provide them with the training, authority, and tools to lead agent-based transformations. Their fluency in both worlds helps align AI initiatives with the broader organizational vision.

Ultimately, your existing BPM knowledge is far from obsolete. **AI Agents** represent a _natural_ evolution, offering more dynamic automation possibilities. Coupled with **AI Models** that deliver predictive muscle, your enterprise can transform processes from simple, rules-based flows into adaptive, intelligent ecosystems — reducing manual work, enhancing customer experiences, and unleashing new innovation cycles.

**My hope** is that this article demystifies the difference between **AI Agents and AI Models** while illustrating how both fit into the familiar BPM landscape. If you’d like a deeper dive — from readiness assessments to actual Python code — my book, [_Enterprise AI: Strategic Blueprint for Purple People_](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0D5RKHXMY), guides you through a step-by-step framework.

**Remember:** The future of enterprise AI isn’t just about building fancy models; it’s about weaving those models into the workflows, tasks, and decisions that power your business every single day. AI Agents provide the scaffolding for these new capabilities — dynamic, context-aware, and ready to elevate your organization into a more intelligent, resilient future.
