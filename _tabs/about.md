The book "Enterprise AI for Purple People" provides a strategic blueprint for organizations looking to harness the transformative potential of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in their business operations. The Enterprise AI Transformation Framework (EAITF) introduced in the book is a structured approach that integrates AI into enterprise decision-making, automation, and intelligence processes, leading to increased efficiency and competitive advantage.

At the core of the EAITF is the concept of Decision Domain Management (DDM), which optimizes both cognitive (strategic decision-making) and non-cognitive (routine tasks) functionalities within an enterprise through AI-driven solutions. The framework emphasizes the synergy between automation and intelligence, ensuring that every AI initiative aligns profoundly with the enterprise's overarching objectives.

The book outlines a step-by-step structure for organizations to perform Decision Domain Profiling, which evaluates various business processes for their AI readiness. It introduces a multi-dimensional scoring system that assesses domains across measurable criteria such as strategic alignment, process maturity, data quality, and AI readiness. This quantitative analysis allows enterprises to prioritize which domains would benefit most from AI implementation.

In conclusion, the EAITF serves not only as a guidebook but also inspires a transformative vision. It empowers organizations to navigate the intricate journey of AI integration, driving innovation and creating sustainable value in an increasingly digital world. The book is supported by references and literature from thought leaders like Davenport, Simon, and Kurzweil, alongside resources that focus on the technicalities of data quality, machine learning operations, and decision support systems.

**Reviewed by Gabriel Santos for Readers' Favorite**

> In Mahmudur Rahman Manna's Elias: The Quest for Meaning, a postgraduate student researching toxic behaviors in the workplace reaches out to Elias Thorn, a prominent expert in corporate culture and leadership. Drawing on his years of experience, Thorn guides the student and the reader on a journey toward understanding problematic behaviors on a deep, psychological level and connecting them to broader principles. The first and second chapters serve as an introduction, the following four tell and discuss the stories of Emma, Ava, Noah, and Sarah (each illustrating a specific problem), and the final one features a conversation about success, fulfillment, and meaning that leads to the unveiling of Thorn's life philosophy.
> This book reminded me of dialogues from ancient philosophers, especially works of exhortation similar to Aristotle's Protrepticus and Cicero's Hortensius, but with a modern twist and more fleshed-out characters. Mahmudur Rahman Manna does a great job of establishing the characters' backgrounds and making them relatable and sympathetic, which is particularly impressive considering the brevity of the book. Elias: The Quest for Meaning tackles several topics, such as distrust, scarcity mindset, and desire for control, with simple and precise language, making them accessible to a large public. Despite the focus on corporate culture, the lessons on behaviors and psychology should be valuable to anyone. The worldview is quite insightful and applicable to many contexts beyond the workplace. Overall, this is a unique title positioned at the intersection between business, psychology, and philosophy, and I recommend it to anyone interested in these subjects.

This book introduces PEPPA (Peace as Purpose, Emotional Intelligence, Proactivity, Patience, and Acceptance), a practical and universal framework designed to enhance human resolve by integrating concepts from physics, philosophy, and psychology. The framework follows five essential stages: Peace as Purpose, Emotional Intelligence, Proactivity, Patience, and Acceptance, each crucial in developing resilience and decisiveness.
Peace as Purpose serves as the foundation, drawing from the universal principle of entropy and equilibrium —the universe moves towards equilibrium—and Viktor Frankl’s emphasis on meaning as a source of strength.
Emotional Intelligence, focused on redirecting attention from unproductive "why" questions to actionable "what" solutions, inspired by Stoicism and Rational Emotive Behavior Therapy (REBT), empowers individuals to manage emotions and maintain clarity under pressure.
Proactivity, grounded in overcoming decision paralysis, reflects Aristotle’s Golden Mean, balancing contemplation with timely action.
Patience, rooted in the physical law of inertia—not forcing decisions or rushing change—echoes the Stoic endurance needed to navigate uncertainty.
Finally, Acceptance, based on the law of equilibrium, aligns with Stoicism and Maslow’s self-actualization, representing the peak of inner resolve where individuals embrace reality as it is.
By incorporating principles of entropy, inertia, and equilibrium, PEPPA offers both a philosophical and scientifically grounded model for building resilience. Its simplicity and structured approach make it accessible to both scholars and practitioners, offering a clear, actionable pathway for overcoming decision paralysis, emotional turmoil, and life’s uncertainties.
